# .gitattributes configuration for customizing language detection on GitHub

# By default, GitHub detects languages based on file extensions.
# Only use the settings below if you want to override GitHub's default detection.

# EXAMPLES:

# 1. If you use a custom extension (like .myext) for Python files:
# *.myext linguist-language=Python

# 2. If you want .rb files (normally Ruby) to be detected as Python:
# *.rb linguist-language=Python
# (Only use this if your .rb files are actually Python code.)

# 3. To classify .glyphs files as OpenStep-Property-List:
# *.glyphs linguist-language=OpenStep-Property-List

# 4. Language names are case-insensitive and aliases are supported:
# *.es linguist-language=py
# *.es linguist-language=PY
# *.es linguist-language=PYTHON

# 5. You do NOT need to override standard file extensions (like .py, .js, .java)
#    unless you have a specific need to do so.
